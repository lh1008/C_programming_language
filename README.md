# C_programming_language

My goal is to learn C

This repository is the effort to understand _C programming language_ by reading, "C Programming Language", by _Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie_.

You will find several files that contain the exercises inside the book. Some of them are actual copies of online code, others are my own effort to create the code.

First file:

- `c_in.c`: This file was the first one. All the code is all mixed up, it compiles but you will find yourself in a little trouble because eventually it's not clear what you're being asked to input. Next files will be in order.

Thank you for reading and taking your time to look at the repository.

Special thanks to [**Holberton School**](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) and [**Monero**](https://web.getmonero.org/) to be my inspiration to take this journey in life.
